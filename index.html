                <h1>SWE Intern @ Rockefeller Wealth Management</h1>
                <p>
                Developed financial insight models based on Alternative Investments, Structured Products, and Industry Sector dimension analysis to help Rockefeller advising groups understand irregularities in their clients’ portfolios. <br><br>
                Used SQL and Python libraries like PySpark, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to enhance insight specific dimensions before tuning the models based on the elbow method for K means clustering. <br><br>
                Deposited insights into a repository and generated APIs used at the enterprise level to generate client and household specific alerts on the advisors’ dashboards.

                <p>
                Engineered Pipelines based off Software Robots constructed using UI Path Studio and Python to automate intricate financial transactions in both classic and modern workflows powered by the .NET Framework.<br><br>
                RPA robots were constructed to handle payroll information for hospital nurses in times of incorrect payroll period entries, paid/unpaid vacations, and overtime work without requiring human inputs.<br><br>
                UI Path Orchestrator was used to manage robots, track data outflow, and report exceptional error messages. Cumulatively robots saved the hospital over 1500hrs/year of manual labor.<br><br>
